# Local CI Runner

Tool for running commands in ci workflow files.
The commands are executed on the local machine.
It is assumed that the required development tools and libraries (compiler, build tools etc) are installed.

This is **very** experimental code.

## Example Usage

```
localcirunner .github/workflows/test.yml
```
